Hello Everyone,
Today, my speech topic is about the Youth Hostel.
When it comes to the Youth Hostel, I must start with its history.
At the turn of the 20th century, a romantic idea occurred to Richard Hillman, a German teacher, that education should not only be in schools, but young people should go out of their schools.They are bound to cultivate their independent personalities and abilities through outings. It's also beneficial for youth to be touch with nature and various culture. In a word, he hoped that teenagers could know the world and themselves in the journey.And thus he wanted to provide teenagers with a place where they can share their thoughts with each other freely and live as a stop in their journey cheaply.So he went everywhere to spread his view and finally it was accepted by people.In 1932, the Youth Hostel Association was established in Amsterdam.
Now, the Youth Hostel has become a cultural symbol presenting freedom and share, not only hostel itself.
From my perspective, I prefer to live in the Youth Hostel rather than common hotel. I love the special atmosphere of the Youth Hostel. As you know, I traveled around China the last year. There are many interesting and meaningful things happening to me in the Youth Hostel. And those things are the best evidence for Hillman's opinions. I will tell you one of those.
In Jiuzhaigou, I lived in the Jiuzhaigou International Youth Hostel.There are nine people in my room. To my surprise, we came from five different nations, China, Japan, the U.S., Singapore and France.As for our Chinese, we were from five different provinces. It's amazing! Everyone stood up a regional culture. We talked a lot from our own culture to sharp comments on hot spots. In this process, we know more about both the world we live in and ourselves, which is very meaningful, I think.
At the last, I hope more and more teenagers choose to live in the Youth Hostel. You will not only spend less money but also gain many impressive experience.
